# Viz for Social Good project on Viz for Social Good

[#VizforSocialGood](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/) helps mission-driven organizations to promote social good and understand their own data through beautiful and informative data visualization; visualizations made by volunteers, like me.  

For this project, Viz for Social Good is looking to visualize its own data.  

The end goal is to:
1) inspire more data professionals to join our initiative by seeing the impact they will be able to make through creating visualizations.
2) to showcase to charities how data can help them achieve their mission much more effectively.

## My Submissions

I decided to highlight the global network of volunteers with networks on a map. The network of the cities from every volunteers who partticipated in a project is drawn on a map, and the cities (nodes) are linked to highlight the network formed for the project. I designed three visualizations, which are similar, but which address different audiences.    

The first visualization is for (future!) volunteers:
